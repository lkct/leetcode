Tags: Hash Table, Two Pointers, String, Sliding Window

### Description
```plain
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Solution 1
Slide left and right pointer from begin to end, and use bins to count apperance of chars.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        bool *bins = new bool[256]();
        int ans = 0;
        int len = s.length();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (j < len)
        {
            while ((!bins[(unsigned char)s[j]]) && (j < len))
            {
                bins[(unsigned char)s[j++]] = true;
            }
            if (j - i > ans)
            {
                ans = j - i;
            }
            if (j == len)
            {
                break;
            }
            while (bins[(unsigned char)s[j]])
            {
                bins[(unsigned char)s[i++]] = false;
            }
        }
        delete[] bins;
        return ans;
    }
};
```
