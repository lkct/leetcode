# 11. Container With Most Water

<https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/>

Difficulty: Medium

Tags: Array, Two Pointers

### Description
```plain
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

IMAGE

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

### Solution 1
When the width reduces, the height must increase to make a possible answer. So use 2 pointers moving from the two ends to the middle, and each move must increase the height of the lower line.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int len = height.size();
        int ans = 0;
        int i = 0, j = len - 1;
        while (i < j)
        {
            int h = min(height[i], height[j]);
            int area = h * (j - i);
            if (area > ans)
            {
                ans = area;
            }
            while ((i < j) && (height[i] <= h))
            {
                i++;
            }
            while ((i < j) && (height[j] <= h))
            {
                j--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
