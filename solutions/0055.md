# 55. Jump Game

<https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/>

Difficulty: Medium

Tags: Array, Greedy

### Description
```plain
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
0 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^5
```

### Solution 1
It can be proven that any index before the farthest reachable index is reachable. Therefore, only record the currently farthest reachable and test if the current index is reachable.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int reach = 0;
        int len = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
        {
            if (i > reach)
            {
                return false;
            }
            if (i + nums[i] > reach)
            {
                reach = i + nums[i];
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
