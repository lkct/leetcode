# 62. Unique Paths

<https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/>

Difficulty: Medium

Tags: Array, Dynamic Programming

### Description
```plain
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

IMAGE
Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

### Solution 1
Dynamic programming. State transition and boundary:
`f[i, j] = f[i - 1, j] + f[i, j - 1]`,
`f[i, 0] = 1, f[0, j] = 1`,
where `f[i, j]` means the number of paths from start to position `(i, j)`. Array dimension `i` can be optimized by implementing scrolling array.

Time Complexity: $O(nm)$

Space Complexity: $O(n), where \ n = \min \{ n, m \}$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if (n > m)
        {
            swap(n, m);
        }
        vector<int> f(n, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
            {
                f[j] += f[j - 1];
            }
        return f[n - 1];
    }
};
```
