# 70. Climbing Stairs

<https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/>

Difficulty: Easy

Tags: Dynamic Programming

### Description
```plain
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution 1
Dynamic Programming. State transition and boundary:
`f[i] = f[i - 1] + f[i - 2]`,
`f[1] = 1, f[2] = 2`,
where `f[i]` means the answer when input is `i`. Array dimension `i` can be optimized by implementing scrolling array with rotation of an array with length 3. NOTE: use length 4 rotation can slightly reduce memory cost on test machine, although allocating more space explicitly.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int f[3];
        f[1] = 1;
        f[2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
        {
            f[i % 3] = f[(i - 1) % 3] + f[(i - 2) % 3];
        }
        return f[n % 3];
    }
};
```

### Solution 2
From the formula in Solution 1, we can get:
`f[i] = (pow((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, i + 1) + pow((1 - sqrt(5)) / 2, i + 1)) / sqrt(5)`,
which can be simplified to:
`f[i] = round(pow((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, i + 1) / sqrt(5))`.
Filling in constants, we can get:
`f[i] = round(pow(1.618..., n + 1)  * 0.447...)`,
where the precision used reaches the limit of `double`.

Time Complexity: $O(1)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        return round(pow(1.618033988749894848, n + 1)  * 0.447213595499957939);
    }
};
```

### Solution 3
Optimization on space based on Solution 1. Only use 2 variables to scroll the array. NOTE: inverse odd and even for `a` and `b` will cause `signed integer overflow` on test machine.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int a = 1, b = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2)
        {
            a += b;
            b += a;
        }
        return (n % 2) ? b : a;
    }
};
```
