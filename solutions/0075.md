# 75. Sort Colors

<https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/>

Difficulty: Medium

Tags: Array, Two Pointers, Sort

### Description
```plain
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Follow up:

A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
```

### Solution 1
Use three pointers `l`, `m`, and `r`, which satisfy that `[0, l)` contains 0, `[l, m)` contains 1, `[m, r)` contains the unsorted, `[r, len)` contains 2. Move the pointers and swap elements to maintain the conditions.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums.size();
        int l = 0, m = 0, r = len;
        while ((l < len) && (nums[l] == 0))
        {
            l++;
        }
        while ((r > 0) && (nums[r - 1] == 2))
        {
            r--;
        }
        m = l;
        while (m < r)
        {
            if (nums[m] == 0)
            {
                swap(nums[m++], nums[l++]);
            }
            else if (nums[m] == 2)
            {
                swap(nums[m], nums[--r]);
            }
            else
            {
                m++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Solution 2
Use STL `partition()` to move all 2 to the end, and then `partition()` again to split 0 and 1.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        typedef vector<int>::iterator it;
        it b = nums.begin(), e = nums.end();
        it m = partition(b, e, [](int x) { return x < 2; });
        partition(b, m, [](int x) { return x < 1; });
    }
};
```
