# 136. Single Number

<https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/>

Difficulty: Easy

Tags: Hash Table, Bit Manipulation

### Description
```plain
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### Solution 1
Use features of Exclusive Or: `a ^ b = b ^ a`, `0 ^ a = a`, `a ^ a = 0`. Therefore, `xor`ing all the numbers will give the only single number. NOTE: using for each loop can be faster.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums.size();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
        {
            ans ^= nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
