# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

<https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/>

Difficulty: Medium

Tags: Hash Table, Linked List

### Description
```plain
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.


Example 1:

IMAGE1

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Example 2:

IMAGE2

Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
Example 3:

IMAGE3

Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Example 4:

Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.


Constraints:

-10000 <= Node.val <= 10000
Node.random is null or pointing to a node in the linked list.
Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.

### Solution 1
Use STL `map<>` to keep a mapping from the old node to the new node when copying the linked list structure, and then use the mapping to copy the random pointers. NOTE: the head of newly allocated list must be initialized with null pointer.

Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$

Space Complexity: $O(n)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = NULL;
        random = NULL;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        map<Node*, Node*> mapping;
        Node *head2 = nullptr, **last = &head2, *cur = head, *cur2;
        while (cur)
        {
            *last = new Node(cur->val);
            mapping.insert(make_pair(cur, *last));
            cur = cur->next;
            last = &(*last)->next;
        }
        cur = head;
        cur2 = head2;
        while (cur)
        {
            cur2->random = mapping[cur->random];
            cur = cur->next;
            cur2 = cur2->next;
        }
        return head2;
    }
};
```

### Solution 2
Modify the input list to interweave with the new list so that the new node can be found by the corresponding old node, making the copying of random pointers easier. The input is restored at the same time when splitting the new from the old.

Time Complexity: $O(n)$

Space Complexity: $O(1)$

##### Code (C++)
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = NULL;
        random = NULL;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (!head)
        {
            return nullptr;
        }
        Node *cur = head, *cur2, *head2;
        while (cur)
        {
            cur2 = new Node(cur->val);
            cur2->next = cur->next;
            cur->next = cur2;
            cur = cur2->next;
        }
        cur = head;
        while (cur)
        {
            cur2 = cur->next;
            if (cur->random)
            {
                cur2->random = cur->random->next;
            }
            cur = cur2->next;
        }
        head2 = head->next;
        cur = head;
        while (cur && (cur2 = cur->next)) // do not correspond to head and head2
        {
            cur->next = cur2->next;
            cur = cur2;
        }
        return head2;
    }
};
